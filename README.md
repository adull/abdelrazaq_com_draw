# Preact Starter

This is my preact starter that I bootstrapped in October 2024. I bootstrapped it off of [create_tw](https://github.com/AndrejJurkin/create-tw) which got deprecated in march yikes lol. This is a really small and quick way to prototype things in react. It has tailwind and axios.

`npm install` > `npm run dev`

# Paper Preact Starter

This is my Paper Preact starter. It has some extra code from something I'm making but if you go to the file

`src/components/Canvas.jsx`

you will see how to use basic paper functions and initialize a paper project. Built off the above.
