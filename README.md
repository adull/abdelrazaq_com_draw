# Preact Starter

This is my preact starter that I bootstrapped in October 2024. I bootstrapped it off of [create_tw](https://github.com/AndrejJurkin/create-tw) which got deprecated in march yikes lol. This is a really small and quick way to prototype things in react. It has tailwind and axios.

`npm install` > `npm run dev`
